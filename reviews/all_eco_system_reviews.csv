This headset I can turn on and off.  Now, I know you're going to say they were made for the Apple eco-system, right?  Probably so.

So, honestly, I can say I wish they would do more with the Droid out of box, but it is what it is.  I also can loose connection inside gym, around so much EMR.  This didn't  happen with Jaybird.

I'm a real head phone snob, but if I had to only pick one thing to put on/in my ears, it'd be these. The extra convenience and features that you get when you've got a lot of other apple stuff. They may not sound like $1000+ electrostats, but I can pop open that case and instantly take a call, listen to a video, go for a run, finish and audio book while doing some chores, without worrying about juggling bluetooth settings, re-pairing, finding a battery or adapter.

These are perfect for comfort, private listening to whatever is on your iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, or any Bluetooth device. They are great for hands free calls, and I love that you don’t have to use both buds. You can hear your surroundings when they are in, but I like that aspect. I don’t feel completely muted from the world when they are in. They charge Super Fast, and they case stays charged for multiple days before I even consider charging it.

New they hold about a 4-5 hour listening charge and 2-3 hour of talk. The case acts like a battery and gives the AirPods about 24 hours of total time. They charge relatively quickly in the case. My only gripe is, not necessarily an Apple issue, but the batteries in these devices are so small they don't last long. My first AirPods lasted about 16 months before they battery life significantly eroded, about 50% in listen/talk. About 24 months they last under an hour. I ended picked up a second pair. They essentially become disposable electronics, kinda pricey. 

Comfort is great for my ear type and they don't fall out easily. Sound quality is good, not great, but within expectations. 

With all of that said, I won't purchase another pair until their battery life is substantially improved. Buying these every year or two is wasteful.",1

So everyone is clear, this is the 2nd generation headphones that are wireless, but with the WIRED charging case in which you need to plug in a lightning cable. 

Battery life and audio quality are decent. Boost lower mid bass, may not be the most accurate, but give the impression of deep bass. Twisting them forwards a bit to get a firmer fit in the ear emphasizes the bass and also points the front mouth. Outgoing audio quality for calls is ok. Not great. Not good. But just okay. Barely acceptable. The other end picks up random noises, and has somewhat softer outgoing audio than better headphones for calls. Also, the audio connection drops quite a bit, so that when you think you're talking to someone, you no longer are. The audio has reverted to the handset/phone. It appears this is due to the sensor that detects being in the ear being too aggressive always thinking the ear pods have been removed from the ear, or maybe due to a defective set. 

Also very annoying is the fact there are virtually no controls on either side, so that to raise or lower the volume, skip the track or repeat a track, you need to take the phone out of your pocket. The Galaxy Buds allow you to skip forwards, repeat or skip back, adjust volume and play/pause by tapping the touch pad on either ear.

If you make a lot of phone calls, the Plantronics Voyager Focus is highly recommended. It has intuitive controls for call control and audio control, has selectable ambient noise cancellation, has a boom noise cancelling microphone, has on head/ear detection sensors, and a very easily accessed and intuitive microphone mute button on the boom. It is a bit bigger though.

For those primarily worried about call quality, the Plantronics M104 has a passive/active noise cancelling mic with a really long boom, and only covers one ear to make it most road/drive legal. This one has the best audio quality in and out (ear piece and while speaking to others) but is mono.",0

He was so happy to find them (because the cheap knockoff from Walmart wasn’t cutting it) but wasn’t sure if they would still work because there was a terrible storm over the weekend plus the customer had a sprinkler system.. low and behold, it still work perfectly fine!! Now, forward about 2 months, he put one headphone in his pocket b/c his case wasn’t handy and forgot about it… washed it TWICE and dried in the dryer before he found or realized he left it in his pocket.. he charged it, put it in his ear and STILL WORKS PERFECTLY!!",1

They were priced on the higher side, but they are so easy-to-use and with all the apple ecosystem, such convenient to connect.

Why 4 stars instead of 5? I have accidentally left 2 pairs in rental cars (National Rental Car will always deny finding them)  and had 1 pair stolen so this is my 4th pair.

They are light weight and quite recognizable. There are some issues with battery life when u talk over phone and listen to some peculiar music with heavy base action.

The price tag you see is worth the money because the clarity on the pods is fantastic.  At first I thought, “ These are over priced standard corded ear buds.”  That is not the case.  It takes a little time to follow instructions to sync them to your iPhone but after that, it is easy street.  Charging is fun and easy and it really fits into the Apple ecosystem.  You just have to get used to carrying a high priced detachable item so you will not loose them.  Have fun and enjoy.",1
238,12,5,Best pair of headphones for the price,2022-11-15 10:07:00,more than 2 years,Can't ask for a better pair of headphones that work in the Apple ecosystem. Made work from home and remote learning ten times better as I did not have cables getting in the way.

Most of my other headphones seal the ear canal, which is great for limiting noise, but then I hated the echoing sound of my own voice in my head.  These fit nicely without completely sealing the ear canal and work flawlessly with the iPhone...not to mention the range for such a small device is amazing.",1
240,13,3,Superb headphones that just don't fit everyone,2020-12-03 11:59:00,2 weeks,"Integration with the Apple ecosystem is superb but the fit is not even close as the wired earpods. Sound also seemed to be lower than the wired ones. I'm not sure if I received a faulty product but I had to always keep it at 60-70% volume to get a decent sound out of it. 

The fit is really loose, there are solutions like silicone tips but most of them won't fit in the case so it's an added duty to put them on and off before and after using them. 

I'd suggest just invest the difference and go with the Airpods Pro or just go with some other options.",0

Very bad design which doesn't allow you to change batteries, the only way out is to replace the airpods which both cost almost the same as the new ones, the design is by purpose by apple who want you to buy a new pair every couple of years. this is not eco friendly at all. In the age of Tesla, where batteries last for 100000 cycles this seems like very outdated battery technology. I am in search for non apple pods",0

You pair them once and they’re automatically connected to the rest of your Apple ecosystem - Apple Watch, iPhone, iPad, MacBook. Just click and switch. Literally that simple.

But working performance with apple products is excellent. Bass and treble are fine, in my opinion. Of course, if the only purpose is to listen to music, there are better music headphones for that price. But how many are only 8 grams? You do not realize whether you put it in your ear or not. Lightweight and stylish. In addition, the box is also very light and modern. You can listen to music for about 4.5 hours. In addition, if you have an Apple ecosystem, switch between devices, etc., the connection time was also very successful. Loudness is also perfect. The only minus side is that it fails to cut out the sounds coming from outside.",1

Great sound quality. No echo during phone calls. If one falls out of your ear, the sound stops in both immediately so you’ll know you dropped one which helps prevent losing them if you’re paying attention. Could have better battery life but they charge quick when placed back inside the case and you’ll be good to go again in under an hour. All in all, happy with my purchase.

I wish I had bought these earlier instead of the BeatsX which malfunctioned just after the 1 year warranty period. 
Two drawbacks are 1) it doesn’t fit my ears properly so I have to put some nonslip cushioned tape on them so they don’t fall out of my ears and 2) they are ugly and looks ridiculous like sticking Sonicare toothbrush refills in your ears.",1

I like the look of the Apple wireless earbuds...but I'm not sure I want to pay another $50 for a better looking earbud. I'm not sure if I have weird ears but the Apple earbuds have never been comfortable to me and ALWAYS falls out of my ears when I'm going hard on a workout. Can't have that.

254,13,5,Genuine Apple with Apple quality,2021-06-12 07:45:00,1 month,"Genuine Apple, all you really need to know.

Apple is the Lexus of electronics, luxury & dependability a great combination.

This is my 3rd pair of these. Buying using my Best Buy Points.

The longer I own Apple products the more I appreciate the Apple system, how everything works together, and does just that, actually works & works well.

These AirPods hold a charge & so does the case for them, so if they run low, you put them back in the case for a few minutes and the come back charged up.

The AirPods are comfortable to wear.  When they 1st came out I thought they would fall out and looked a little goofy. When I got my 1st set I bought a small accessory kit to help hold them in place.  I haven’t used any of those items for them yet.

They connect easily to my phone & iPads.  A true wireless device.  It’s nice to not have the cord in the way.

These sound great for calls or listening to music.  The call quality sounds just like you would expect, no issues at all.

When you get texts, they can be set to Have Siri read Them to you and offer an opportunity to respond. So your phone can stay in your pocket. 

A quick tap on the AirPod answers calls, or can do a redial.

The little case helps to keep these clean.

Worth the price of admission.  So much that I have mine, I got a set for my wife, and a 3rd backup pair in case something gets lost.",1

Drawback is when u are talking on AirPods and get into your car, the iPhone switches to car Bluetooth. But when I switched back to AirPods while in car, I cannot hear anything and other people in conference meeting complained they are hearing echo. So I was completely unaware if anyone talking or on mute. So I have to switch back to car Bluetooth.

Other than usage in car, it works perfect.",1
256,13,4,Really glad I got these!,2020-08-26 11:48:00,1 month,"Before I got these AirPods, I had just bought the latest version of JLab  Air Icons because the reviews were so great- with a very affordable price. Mistake! When I reviewed the JLabs I was still on the fence but giving them a chance. No matter which size of the cusions/sleeves I used-- they were always uncomfortable in my small ears and I couldn't even use with phone calls because of echo/muffled sound.
 
I decided to return them when I saw the first gen Airpods on sale at Best Buy.  The reason I didn't go right to AirPods was because of the price- I've always thought it pretentious and unnecessary of Apple to charge so much for their products! But truth is, they make good products and I love these  AirPods! They fit like traditional Apple earbuds which have always been comfortable for me.  So I finally have wireless earbuds that are comfortable and I am actually using! The only drawback is it's not great quality while using with phone calls. There's a sort of hollow sound, but they do work and work better on the phone than the JLabs did, therefor I'm giving them an Excellent for Quality. 
So... I'm happy with these pretentious costly little things!!",1
257,13,5,Super Convenient,2019-09-13 19:47:00,3 weeks,"I swear it's not only for the looks you get but the stereotypical ""I can afford AirPods"" appearance will definitely attract similar individuals with ""electric-toothbrush-head-looking"" earphones hanging from your ears. But in all seriousness, if you're in the Apple ecosystem (have iPhone, iPad, MacBook, etc.), this is the most convenient, truly wireless, smallest package you can get. 

Cons:
-Sound quality is only as good as the EarPods that come with your older iPhones. No bass, and not much volume. 
-Only good for Apple devices, pairing through android devices require additional setup in the Bluetooth settings.
-Kind of obnoxious
-Can be lost easily if they do not fit snug in your ears
-Price is high
-No water resistance or IP rating (be careful to dry them off if you plan on using these for the gym!)


Pros:
-Very light and easy to travel with
-Seamless pairing with Apple devices (switching across Apple devices is easy too)
-Battery life is great (I'm averaging 1.5-2 days on a full charge)
-This version has no wireless charging capability (charges only with lightning cable) , but you can upgrade to the $179 for that
-Decent build quality-both case and AirPods themselves

I really hesitated on this one but after I tested a friend's, I was convinced that the device integration is too great to pass up.",1
258,13,5,The Perfect Fit,2023-05-24 20:38:00,Not Available,"I got my first pair of AirPods a few years ago, and have most recently gotten new ones for Christmas. I listen to music all day every day and couldn’t go a day without it, so I needed to buy headphones that would support what I was looking for. The sound quality on AirPods varies depending on the generation you buy, so why didn't I just buy the newest generation and call it a done deal? Well, I didn't only want the quality to sound crystal clear, I also wanted them to be comfortable to wear for hours on end, I didn’t want big bulky headphones I couldn't bring anywhere, and I wanted a long battery life. One of the very major audio differences between the 2nd Gens and the 1st Gens is the bass. The bass system for the 2nd Gen AirPods is upgraded, new, and improved, and sounds great. The 2nd Gen AirPods may not have the best sound quality out of all of the generations, however, personally, I feel 2nd Gens are far more comfortable than the others. Even with the AirPod Pro “seal”, 2nd Gen AirPods are more comfortable to wear and don’t “fall out of your ears” which several people who have purchased the AirPod Pros have complained about. Obviously, this specific kind of AirPod is not an actual pair of headphones, which I was trying to stay away from, so that eliminated the AirPods Max - which are Airpods over-ear headphones. My final requirement for my earbuds was long-lasting battery life to last me throughout the day. Luckily, the 2nd Generation has a 24-hour battery life, as well as a case that has several full charges built in. The “Perfect Pair” for me may not be the same as you so do research and explore your own needs and requirements! But, if you're like me and have similar needs or wants for earbuds, consider buying these! The 2nd Gen AirPods have been my favorite pair of earbuds for years, maybe they will be yours too!",1
259,13,4,Pretty Good for the Price.,2023-02-20 13:11:00,1 month,"Like all things in the Apple ecosystem, they're a bit overpriced. Sure, they're ""pretty comfortable"" and they sound ""pretty good."" The pairing is quick and easy, and they don't stick straight out of your ears like most other brands.

That being said, they're Apple. That means you're either going to accept the price and the color, or you're going to complain about them for no reason. I hate to say this, but I paid too much for these EXCEPT they went on sale one day after I bought them, and Best Buy was good enough to refund the difference the next day. So for what I really paid, they're ""pretty good.""

What kills me most is how Apple suckers you into buying too much stuff. THESE DO NOT HAVE WIRELESS CHARGING - If you want wireless charging, just spend the extra cash for the 3rd generation. It's not worth buying these, and then spending another $79 for an upgraded case for them, unless you REALLY need to have THIS shape instead of the 3rd generation.

One big complaint however. The case lid does not close flush all the way around. I know that sounds like a first-world problem that only an Apple person would complain about, but it allows pocket lint and whatnot to enter the gap in the case. That FOD then gets jammed into the hard-to-clean parts of the case, and looks pretty gross after just a little while.

Overall, Apple really did make these things mainstream and streamlined, and AirPods are probably the best wireless earbuds you're going to find. I never thought I'd say such a thing. I still hate that I've gone to the dark side though, especially since they don't even come in black.",1
260,14,5,"Surprised, though I shouldn't have been",2019-09-13 16:17:00,1 month,"First off, I've always liked Apple's included EarPods with each iPhone I've had. Yes, I'm deep in the Apple ecosystem. For a while I have been using a pair of PowerBeats3 for music listening with my phone. I always found them to not fit quite right or not fit me correctly. I got the AirPods and they fit just like the wired EarPods in my ears. Good for me, maybe not for you. THAT more than anything should help you decide to buy these or not. They stay in my ears but I would be wary using them for runs or heavy aerobic exercise. There are third party kits out there that add hooks and neck straps and such to make the more fitting to such use.

What I like about AirPods that was the reason I originally bought the PowerBeats3 is that once they're paired to one Apple device, they are paired to all of them. I can be listening on my phone, get home, hop on my MacBook and with a click my home library is playing in my ears instead. Multiple Macs, your phone, maybe a tablet, this was a handy feature and heavily used by me. Controls can be mapped to tap controls on the pods themselves. Personally, I like play/pause and call answering on the right and track skipping on the left. What I miss is volume control. It's a drawback to use one's phone or Apple Watch to control an important portion of AirPods use but that's the trade off. Compared to many other bluetooth headsets battery life is low. However, compared with other completely wireless buds the numbers are closer. Considering the size of these it's really a feat how much they do pack. Then there's the charging case that holds an extra charge.

My impressions are this: others hear me clearly and clean. One pod is drained more than the other, it's basically the master tying them both to the device for signal, input, output, etc. But what surprised me that I did not expect was when I went back to my PowerBeats... I think the AirPods sound better. Again, it could be an ear canal issue since these fit me better I hear the highs and lows, trebles and basses. I really enjoy these and only lament a volume control. They are hardly out of ears.",1
261,14,5,Greay,2019-08-24 09:09:00,3 weeks,"After using the AirPods for several hours a day for a month, there's a lot to like about Apple's first foray into truly wireless headphones. I used the AirPods just one bud at a time while listening to music/podcasts and for short phone calls in an office setting. Pros: Bluetooth Connection: Due to Apple's W1 chip, the bluetooth connection is very strong, seemingly up to and beyond 30-50 feet. I was able to walk downstairs in a building and still maintain connection while my iPhone was still on the second floor. Also, the phone reception seems strong as whenever I was on the phone people generally heard me fine. Auto Stop: If you're listening to music and you remove one of the buds, whatever you're listening to will stop automatically due to sensors in the buds. I've used this feature countless times, especially whenenver someone starts a conversation with me while I'm listening to music while sitting at my desk. Now I just remove the buds(s) and I don't have to worry about fumbling around for the ""pause"" button either on my headphones or iPhone. Single Pod: I nearly always use the AirPods just one bud at a time, both in an effort to conserve battery life and to be more aware of my surroundings. This is a huge plus for me, since I'm used to the neckband-style headphones in which one of the buds was never used (and usually just dangled down the front of my shirt). Also a plus is that there's a microphone in both buds, rather than just a single one. Case: An underrated element of the AirPods is the thing that you don't actually put in your ears. It's the charging case. This thing will always be by your side, because once you take one of the buds out, there's nowhere to put it without risk of losing it. The buds magnetically lock into place in the case, so once they're in, they're not going anywhere, even with the case lid open. The case itself could feel a little sturdier as you'll almost want to buy a case for your case, but it's a great way to keep both pods and the charging system all in one little package that's barely larger than a pack of floss. Charging: Whenever you put the buds in the case, they'll automatically start changing. And these things charge fast. I placed one bud in the case once its battery life was down to 11% remaining and in exactly 10 mins it was already up to 77%. You do have to charge the case itself occasionally, but as long as you have the case around, the 5-hour battery life will never become an issue. Pairing: Thanks to Apple's W1 chip, these are the easiest bluetooth headphones to pair for iOS devices. For intial pairing, simply open the top of the charging case next to your iOS device, tap ""connect"" on the popup, and that's it. No messing around in the Settings section of your device, no holding a combination of buttons a certain number of seconds. And everytime after that, simply remove the bud(s) from the case, place it in your ear, and you'll be automatically connected. Convenience: This might be the AirPods' biggest pro. I'm not sure the convenience of a truly wireless experience and automatic pairing can be overstated. Being able to pop a single bud in your ear, have it connect automatically, and almost always have a full battery is like magic. Taking the headphones off and not having to turn them off/on is also a nice cherry on top.",1
262,14,4,Great for Apple device owners,2021-08-05 13:05:00,Not Available,"Great headphones. Especially if you're in the Apple ecosystem. They automatically connect to my iPhone, iPad, AppleTV - whatever I'm using at the moment. Compact and fits well. Can be used while laying on your side with no discomfort. Only knock her is battery life. With higher volumes or noise canceling on you'll only get get a lot of playback. So that sucks. The good thing is that you can get a quick 3-5 recharge and you'll be good to go again. The device tracking in the Apple Find My app is helpful so see where you last used it. The ping location sound is also helpful to track them down further. Price is high for what you get, but that's typical Apple; besides they do offer some features with Apple devices you just can't get anywhere else.",1
